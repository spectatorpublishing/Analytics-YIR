            "Spectator creates publications and products that aim to help our audience make the most of their Columbia experience. Gaining a better understanding of how Columbia and the wider Morningside Heights communities interact with our content, from our audience demographics to our newsletter click-through rates, is one part of Spectatorâ€™s engagement mission; the other is to equip readers with the information they need to critically examine community-wide issues.",
            "To fulfill this mission, we have extracted and dissected insights from Google Analytics, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter from both the 2019 and 2020 calendar years.* Although 2020 was a tumultuous year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope that this report will shed light on the impact and reach of our work and allow you to deduce creative and strategic ways to move forward this year.",
