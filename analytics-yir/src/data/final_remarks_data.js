            "Both the University and Spectator were struck hard by the pandemic and the subsequent loss of our campus community. Spectator’s mission to hold those in power accountable for their decisions proved effective as our staff provided in-depth coverage of the challenges that 2020 provided. ",
            "As the COVID-19 pandemic upended the spring semester for Columbia students, our News team kept the student body informed about the pandemic. Former News Editor Valeria Escobar’s reporting on the tragic passing of an International House student from COVID-19 and staff writer Griffin Jones’ article on Columbia’s decision to implement a mandatory pass/fail grading system garnered 16,687 pageviews and 13,256 pageviews, respectively.",
            "Likewise, former Deputy News Editor Sofia Partida’s piece delving into the tension between Columbia’s reputation as one of the world’s top universities and its rising price of tuition—accompanied by data analysis and graphics by Graphics Editor Jessica Li, former Deputy Graphics Editor Jason Kao, and Graphics reporter Mike Fu—was the seventh-most read article of 2020, generating a total of 13,998 pageviews.", 
            "Arts and Entertainment Editor Noah Sheidlower’s article examining the plight faced by Morningside Heights eateries at the start of the pandemic amassed 6,905 pageviews and was the most read A&E article of the 2020 calendar year. ",

            "Overall, Spectator’s commitment to elevate the voice of the Columbia and larger Morningside Heights communities—whether through Sports’ first hand reporting on hundreds of Columbia athletes’ feelings navigating a canceled season or perhaps premature ends to their career, or Video’s live coverage of students and Morningside Heights residents’ reflections on the presidential election—stood as a beacon of our core values as a student-run media organization.",
            
            "Just as Spectator soared amid the challenges brought by 2020, we have high expectations for 2021. While we cannot predict the future, we can predict successful outcomes if the necessary ingredients are supplied and utilized. Reading this report, it is clear that Spectator’s staff poured hard work and love into each and every piece for its readers and users this past year. ",
            
            "We know Spectator is a force to be reckoned with and will remain one, so long as the very staff who encompasses our organization continues to outdo itself and fulfill our mission.", 
            "We are grateful to our beloved staff for taking the time to read through our analytics report, and we hope that you found our compiled data useful. It would be our pleasure to grow our staff (and audience) spotlights and article performance data analysis in the future, so please do continue to think about and reach out to us for any data reporting you need in the future.",

            "Kind regards, ",
