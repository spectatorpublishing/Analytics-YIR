            "To start off, the Columbia Daily Spectator audience’s age demographic did not vary significantly from 2019 to 2020. This year, readership among college students and young adults aged 18-24 saw the largest increase (5.4 percent), while the percent readership of adults ranging from 25-34 saw the largest dropoff in readership (3.8 percent). Most strikingly, as it is not the typical college student age range, the majority of our audience consists of young adults between 25-34 years old—most likely alumni and graduate students who read Spectator as a means to stay in the know about what’s going on in and around campus. To connect and extract insights on the relation between age and content engagement, we found that institutional issues tend to attract readers from all ages whereas undergraduate student life content tends to exclude older age groups.
