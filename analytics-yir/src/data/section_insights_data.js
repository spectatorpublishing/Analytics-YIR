            "As 2020 brought unexpected changes to both the Columbia community and the world at large, our readers turned to Spectator for accurate and timely information about ongoing developments. From Columbia’s initial suspension of classes last March due to early cases of COVID-19 to student deaths related to the virus, Spectator provided students with a way to understand the pandemic’s implications as it developed. Both aforementioned stories received 12,358 page views and 16,696 page views respectively. As the year progressed, the fall semester’s abrupt shift to online-only learning just a few weeks before the start of classes sparked uncertainty about what the ensuing school year would bring; with this uncertainty came an increased readership of articles on fall 2020 campus guidelines. Outside of the COVID-19 transition, the University marching band’s disbandment added to the school year’s already disruptive start. This prompted students to seek out information about the shocking news, making it the most-viewed article of 2020."
